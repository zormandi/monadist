# Monadist

A practical and useful Ruby implementation of a couple of popular monads.
Method naming follows the Haskell convention so the gem can be used for trying to understand monads
(mostly described in tutorials using Haskell).

Monads implemented:

* Identity (for educational purposes)
* Maybe
* List
* Continuation
* Meanwhile

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'monadist'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install monadist
